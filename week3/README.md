# Week 3 Task

Week 3 task is to demonstrate the understanding of virtualization and containerization.

# What is virtualization?

Virtualization is the technology that creates an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the physical hardware elements (CPU cores, memory, disk) of a single computer to be divided into  multiple virtual computers. It has its own Guest OS, Kernel, process, drivers etc. Popular virtualization platforms include VMWare, SOlarWInds Virtualization Manager, Citrix, Oracle, Mirosoft, Amazon etc


# What is containerization ?
Containerization is a technology that virtualizes the OS. It abstracts the host operating system and makes containerized applications portable and able to run uniformly and consistently cross any platform or cloud. Containerization involves packaging up software code and all its dependencies so that it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure.

# Benefits of containerization
* Agility
* Portability
* Faultt isolation
* Speed
* Efficiency
* Ease of managemnt
* Security

The major difference between virtual machines and containers is that containers do not bundle in a copy of the operating system. Instead, the contianer runtime engine is istalled on the host system's operating system.
